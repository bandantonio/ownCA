# Purpose
ownCA is a project aimed at providing users with the possibility of creating and managing their own Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) using the built-in web interface. 

# Overview
In its core idea ownCA is similar to [easy-rsa](https://github.com/OpenVPN/easy-rsa) project. The major difference between them is that easy-rsa is a CLI utility, whereas ownCA is a web-based tool.

# Use Cases
* Private network with limited number of computers that need to intercommunicate with each other using a secured data channel (no need to sign with a real CA).

# Benefits
* Free solution
* Personal trust issuing authority
